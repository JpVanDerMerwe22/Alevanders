# Alevanders
Ongoing project website for Alevanders Studio
1st examaple

#### Purpose
```
This is a website wich I made in HyperionDev's web development bootcamp.
It is a website for a photographer, that I have to design front and back end, I am using it as an ongoing capstone project. 
When the website is fully functional and complete, the owner will revise and give me all the correct information
that needs to be displayed. It will then be hosted and used for her business.
While I progress through the bootcamp, I will improve the website as I learn more aspects of web development.
