    <h2>Behind the lens of Alevanders</h2>
    <div class="block1">
        <p>Alevanders a small boutique studio, now situated in the small west Rand Town of Krugersdorp, Gauteng, is
            owned and managed by Carin, a talented photographer with a special love and passion for her work.
            <br>
            You will find Carin, a mom of 3 little busy bodies, a funny conversationalist with a little bit of jazz in
            her boots and a whole lot of love for photographic style that pops the moment she takes hold of her camera.
            In 2009 she took on the "deeper teachings'' of art and style in the form of photography, videography and
            graphic design. Her love for artistic, emotional and timeless photographs started in a small, farm styled
            town in the free state.

    <h2>About Alevanders</h2>
    <div class="block2">
        <p>Artistic, Emotional. Timeless. Cinematically inspired with style - that is what Alevanders is all about.
            From the passions, feelings, memories, essence and the down right funny bloopers of everything inbetween. -
            "I enjoy every second of every moment to the fullest ... I feel the excitement of each moment at least 3
            times... anything extra is a blessing especially when you are able to relive the moments. I get excited as
            the moments are taken in, then as I work with it in post production, and then as my clients have their first
            look through my "lens" of how beautiful they are in my world.</p>
